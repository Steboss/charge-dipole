Frist test for the re-weigth script

In this case I have simulated a sodium ion in different box sizes
with different cutoffs and I am computing the correction terms:

1) BWRF within the box
2) BWRF shifted within the box

once charge-dipole is ready:

3) BWRF over all the box
4) BWRF shifted over all the box
