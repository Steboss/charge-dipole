Can we define the overlap between RF-thery and RF calculations by taking the single point 
calculations?
in this folder I am going to test carge-dipole interactions (computed with BWRF) and my 
derived RF charge-dipole at different theta and dipole bond length l.



Usage:

In inputfiles there are the TOP, CRD and rotation.py  script

rotation.py creates all the folders, scaling the dipole bondlength by 100 values
In each folder "l_*" there are 120 folders, referred to the angle theta between
the ion and the dipole.
Theta is scan from 0 to 360 by 3 deg. In each "*_deg" folder the computed results "computed.dat"
and theoretical calculations "theory.dat" are saved. In these files the potential 
energy and the distances are saved.

For each folder I have created a "create_plot.py" to save png images of plots where I am comparing
the computed results with theoretical ones. Furthermore, in each "l_*" folder I have create an 
ipynb, to visualize all the plots and see when there is an agreement between theory and prediction
(treshold <0.01 kcal/mol) 

Finall, once all the "l_*" folder are created, everything can be analyzed running "analyze.sh".
The script will create "theta_dist.csv" file, where the dipol bond length, theta and distance where
the two curves overlap are written.

This "theta_dist.csv"  file is then processed in "heatmap_distance.ipynb", to create an heat map and
a plot with the average distance +/- std.err
