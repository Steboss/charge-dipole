Here I am trying to study the rotationally average charge dipole
potential by playing with Sire
Unfortunately this test won't work
The problem is that we ar emissing a weight in the algorithm,  which 
cannot be implemented, since it comes from an ensemble average
Thus, if we were running a simulation with charge and dipole we 
would obtain the correct answer
