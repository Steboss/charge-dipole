Analyses of th ewater orientation in a sodium ion simulation
In this test we want to verify if there is an orientational correlation 
in the very first solvation shells  and if the Coulombic potential
will be the same after the relevant solvation shells (~15 A?)

Files:

master.py : master script to be run to start the analysis

orientation_distribution_function.py : script which actually performs the 
orientational analysis

parser.py : parser to average all the outputfiles

traj*.dcd : trajectory

output_average: final results + analysis notebook


Usage:

python master traj*.dcd ../input/SYSTEM.top ../input/SYSTEM.crd

the script automatically will divide the load of the job into 8 processes 
which will analyse 2500 frames each ( ~ 1 h of calculation)

python parser.py  
this script will give the output_average folder
